## ðŸ¤” ABOUT ME?
Sure!
_I graduated from a semi-public university in Iran with a bachelor's degree in information technology. Because of my interest in open source programming languages, I started learning PHP and I have been programming since I was 23 years old._

_Due to the interest of learning more deeply in this language and the Laravel framework, I practice programming and I am looking for a challenge in the field of programming. I am also learning other languages and other technologies._
